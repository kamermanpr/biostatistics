### Instructions
Download the datasets, and for each dataset:  
- Tidy the data (if nessesary);
- Explore the data with plots;  
- State the _null_ and _alternative_ hypotheses;  
- State the statistical test(s) you are going to use, and the assumptions that underlie the test(s);  
- Provide the test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and your interpretation of the outcome of the analysis.   

Use _git_ for version control, and push the completed assignment to your _GitHub_ repository. Send a link to the repository to [Peter Kamerman](mailto:peter.kamerman@gmail.com).

## Dataset 1
### Chicken weights
An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement. Their weights in grams after six weeks are given along with feed types. The data from this experiment can be downloaded from [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/chick-weights.csv?dl=1).

## Dataset 2
### Blood pressure measurement
A BSc III project was undertaken to assess the agreement in systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements between the conventional auscultatory method, assessed by a nursing sister with 15-yearâ€™s experience, and a new automated oscillometric blood pressure measuring device. Eighty-five (85) subjects had their blood pressures assessed, with three replicate measurements recorded by each of the two methods of measurement (nurse using auscultation, and oscillometric device). The data from this experiment can be downloaded from [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/blood-pressure.csv?dl=1).

## Dataset 3
### The Hot Zone
To investigate whether an outbreak of severe gastroenteritis in a samll town was caused by contaimination of the drinking water, investigators collected data on water consumption per day and the number of people who fell ill. The data from the study can be downloaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/gastroenteritis.csv?dl=1).

## Dataset 4
### Nausea
Eight patients recieving emetogenic chemotherapy for breast cancer were asked to rate the intenisty of their nausea before and after receiving a 5HT~3~-receptor blocker. A numeric rating scale, anchored at 0 (no nausea) to 6 (severe nausea and vomiting) was used to rate nausea intensity. The data from the study can be downloaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/nausea.csv?dl=1).
