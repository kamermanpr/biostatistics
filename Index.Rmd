## Getting started
[(back to: TOC)](#table-of-contents)

The aims of the course are to introduce the basics of data wrangling, and reproducible data analysis and reporting. These aims are explored using the statistical computing programme [_R_](//www.r-project.org/) in the [_Rstudio_](//www.rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE), and [_git_](https://git-scm.com/) (with the [_GitHub_](//github.com/) web-based Git repository hosting service) for version control. The reason for choosing these apps is that they are free (as in beer and as in speech), and have well-established and active user and developer communities. You will need to a basic working knowledge of the command line, R and Git to complete the course. So, if you are not familiar with these apps I suggest that you prepare yourself by completing some free online courses before starting ([see examples below](#free-courses)).

### Software downloads
[(back to: TOC)](#table-of-contents)

_**Please note:** For students attending the tutorials, you will be given a memory stick with the lastest portable versions of R, RStudio, and Git installed. However, if you have a personal laptop or desktop, I recommend you install the software onto those devices._

* [_R_](//cran.r-project.org) (available for: Windows, Mac, and Linux)
* [_RStudio Desktop_](//www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (available for: Windows, Mac, and Linux. Only install after you have installed _R_)
* [_git_](//git-scm.com/downloads) (available for: Windows, Mac, and Linux)
* [_Github desktop client_](//desktop.github.com) (available for: Windows and Mac only)

Once you have downloaded and installed _R_ and _RStudio_, I recommend that you install the following _R_ packages (you may need others during the course, but these will get you going):

* _knitr_, _rmarkdown_, _dplyr_, _tidyr_, _lubridate_, _readr_, _ggplot2_, _swirl_

You can install the packages directly from the _R_ console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'dplyr',
                   'tidyr', 'lubridate', 'readr',
                   'swirl'))
```

...or using _RStudio_:
