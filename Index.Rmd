# Introduction to Biostatistics
An introductory course on data handling and biostatistics for students studying towards a Bachelor of Health Sciences (BHSc) Honours in Physiology at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. The course is based around the statistical programming language [_R_](//www.r-project.org).

The aims of the course are to introduce you to the basics of data wrangling, and reproducible data analysis and reporting. These aims are explored using the statistical computing programme [_R_](//www.r-project.org/) in the [_RStudio_](//www.rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE), and [_git_](//git-scm.com/) (with the [_GitHub_](//github.com/) web-based _git_ repository hosting service) for version control. The reason for choosing these apps is that they are free _(as in beer and as in speech)_, and have well-established and active user and developer communities. You need a basic working knowledge of the _command line_, _R_ and _git_ to complete the course. So if you are not familiar with these apps, I suggest that you complete some free online courses before starting ([see examples below](#free-courses)).

## Course assessment

There will be one project that will constitute the _year mark_ for the course. You **may not work** on the project in groups. Details of the project will be posted at a later date.

The biostatistics component of your mid-year exams will count 60% of the final biostatistics mark (the project will count 40%).

## Assignments

The assignments are your chance to get hands-on experience applying what you learn in the lectures. The assignments will take place with the course instructor in the computer laboratory immediately after the relevant lecture has finished. You may work alone or in groups.

## Resources

### Getting started

#### Configuring git
**Global configuration**  

You need to configure _git_ after you first install it. If you are going to be the only one using the computer, then open _Terminal_ (OSX and Linux) or _Git Bash_ (Windows) and enter the following text _(substituting your username and email address as required)_:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your@email.com

```

You are then ready to initiate your first _git_ repository:

```
git init <path/to/directory> 

# NOTE: There is no need to add the path if you already 
# are in the directory you want to initiate.
```

**Local project configuration**  

If you configure your computer using the ```--global``` tag, you only have to enter this information once. Thereafter, _git_ will assume that any new repository initiations/changes are being made by you. As you may expect then, configuring your user details with the ```--global``` tag is not a good idea if the computer you use has multiple users working, for example, through a 'Guest Account'. In that situation, rather individually set the user configuration for each directory (project) you initiate as follows: 

- Open _Terminal_ (OSX and Linux) or _Git Bash_ (Windows) and navigate to the directory you want to initiate as a repository;

- Enter the following text _(substituting your username and email address as required)_:

```
git init
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email your@email.com
```

Your user information will only be associated with the repository you initiated. 

### Pushing commits to a GitHub remote

The GIF below demonstrates the process of initiating folder as a git repository, configuring it, adding a file, and _pushing_ the file to an empty GitHub repository. It also shows how to add files in GitHub and then _pull_ them locally. 

When pushing to the remote, you will be asked for a username and password. Input the username and password for your _GitHub_ account. If you get this username/password request everytime you try push to the remote, and you are on your own computer, then instead of typing in your _GitHub_ account password, get a _personal access token_ and paste that in the password dialogue box. That should stop the username/password requests. Instructions on how to get a _personal access token_ can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/).

### Proxy problems

If you are working behind a corporate proxy, you may run into problems with pushing _git_ commits to your _remote_, and installing packages in _R_. The following options should help solve the problem.

#### For git

_(NOTE: All settings can be set specifically for the local project by omitting the ```--global``` tag.)_  

Enter the follwing commands in the _Terminal_ (OSX or Linux) or _Git Bash_ (Windows) _(substituting your server details as required)_:

```
git config --global http.proxy http://proxyserver.com:8080
git config --global https.proxy https://proxy.server.com:8080
```
- Change _proxy.server.com_ to the address of your proxy server

- Change _8080_ to the proxy port configured on your proxy server

Try the settings above, but if your proxy protests that it needs a username and password ('407 Authentication Warning'), add the following **(not a great option on a computer used by multiple users)**:

```
git config --global http.proxy http://proxyusername:proxypassword@proxyserver.com:8080

git config --global https.proxy https://proxyusername:proxypasswordproxy.server.com:8080
```
- Change _proxyusername_ to your proxy username

- Change _proxypassword_ to your proxy password

If you want to clear your proxy settings (e.g., if you are working on a laptop that you use at home and at work), enter the following commands in _Terminal_ or _Git Bash_:

```
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

#### For R/RStudio

You need to add an _.Renviron_ file to your _R_ home directory. This file is read by _R_ at startup, and needs to include proxy settings if you want to access the internet through _R/RStudio_. 

On OSX and Linux machines the home directory is usually your 'user.name' directory (```/User/user.name```). On Windows machines the home directory is usually the the users 'Documents' library (```C:\Users\user.name\Documents```). If you cannot locate your home directory, enter the following in _R_:

```
path.expand("~")
```

The _.Renviron_ file should contain the proxy settings specific to your location. The file must be in your _R_ home directory before you start _R/RStudio_, but remember that it is a hidden file, so you will have to have your file view set to show hidden files if you want to see the file _in situ_. The following is an example of the text that should be in the _.Renviron_ file:

```
http_proxy=http://proxyserver.com:8080
http_proxy_user=ask
https_proxy=https://proxyserver.com:80
https_proxy_user=ask
```

If you don't know how to create a hidden _'dot'_ file, here are some instructions on how to do so from _Terminal_ (OSX and Linux) or _Git Bash_ (Windows):

1. Open _Terminal_ or _Git Bash_.

2. Navigate to your _R_ home directory.

3. Copy and paste the following text at the command prompt _(remember to change the proxyserver and port as required)_:

```
(echo http_proxy=http://proxyserver.com:8080
echo http_proxy_user=ask
echo https_proxy=https://proxyserver.com:8080
echo https_proxy_user=ask) > .Renviron
```

When you are outside of the work setting and can access the internet without a proxy, either rename the _.Renviron_ file, move the file to another directory, or delete the file before opening _R/RStudio_. 

In addition to adding the _.Renviron_ file, you also need to change some settings in _RStudio_. The GIF below shows you the steps on a Windows machine, but it is the same on OSX and Linux, expect there is no _'Use Internet Explorer library/proxy for HTTP'_ checkbox.

### Software downloads

* [_R_](//cran.r-project.org) (available for: Windows, Mac, and Linux)
* [_RStudio Desktop_](//www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (available for: Windows, Mac, and Linux. Only install after you have installed _R_)
* [_git_](//git-scm.com/downloads) (available for: Windows, Mac, and Linux)
* [_Github desktop client_](//desktop.github.com) (available for: Windows and Mac only)

Once you have downloaded and installed _R_ and _RStudio_, I recommend that you install the following _R_ packages (you may need others during the course, but these will get you going):

* _knitr_, _rmarkdown_, _dplyr_, _tidyr_, _lubridate_, _readr_, _ggplot2_, _swirl_

You can install the packages directly from the _R_ console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'dplyr',
                   'tidyr', 'lubridate', 'readr',
                   'ggplot2', 'swirl'))
```

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="./images/install-packages-1.gif" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
</p>

...or using _RStudio_:
